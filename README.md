# Bank Customer Churn Analysis

This project aims to analyze the factors that lead bank customers to leave the company using the Bank Customer Churn dataset available on Kaggle. The dataset contains information about 10,000 customers, including their credit score, location, gender, age, tenure, account balance, number of products purchased, credit card ownership, activity status, estimated salary, complaints, satisfaction score, card type, and points earned.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset will be preprocessed using common techniques in data cleaning and preparation using Python libraries such as Pandas. This includes handling missing and outlier values, converting data types, and feature engineering.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis will be performed to gain insights into the relationships between variables and identify patterns in the data. This will involve analyzing the correlation between variables and visualizing the data using plots and charts.

## Modeling

Various machine learning models will be trained on the preprocessed data to predict customer churn. Commonly used models such as logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and XGBoost will be employed. The models will be evaluated using cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Results and Conclusion

The performance of the models will be evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The results will be interpreted to gain insights into the factors that contribute to customer churn and to suggest strategies for churn prevention. Finally, future directions for improvement will be discussed.

## Acknowledgements

As mentioned in the dataset description, it is more expensive for banks to sign in new clients than to retain existing ones. Therefore, it is advantageous for banks to know what leads a client towards the decision to leave the company. Churn prevention allows companies to develop loyalty programs and retention campaigns to keep as many customers as possible.
